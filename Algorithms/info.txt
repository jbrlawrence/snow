Activity 1 - Algorithms

This activity is designed to accompany the Art Canada Institute Teacher Resource Guide 
titled "Understanding Computer Science Through the Art of Michael Snow".

In this directory you will find a file written for the Processing development environment, 
writtend in Java. This file uses a webcam to recreate the artwork

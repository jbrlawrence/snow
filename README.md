The resources linked in this directory are designed to accompany the Art Canada Institute Teacher Resource Guide titled *Understanding Computer Science Through the Art of Michael Snow*.

In this directory you will find two folders. The first "Algorithms" is intended to accompany the first activity of the guide, and contains an example of how algorithms can be used to create art, in this case re-creating the process of the artwork *Authorization*, Michael Snow, 1969.

In the second directory "Loops" contains resources to support the second activity of the guide. This contains an example of how a complex abstract work can be created using simple shapes, loops and randomness, inspired by the work of Micheal Snow.
